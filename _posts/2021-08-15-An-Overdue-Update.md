Hello folks! 

I know it's been a while and the radio silence was due to a few factors and all relate to me but the long story short, I prefer to roll my own web server and technology issues kept getting in my way especially the internet. 

But enough about that. Time to talk about the game. The game is slowly coming along with more design work being done. Some implementation of systems is underway. I have a Notion workspace that has many To Do Lists relating to each level of the game. I just finished playing Trigger Witch last night which is great because I learnt a few lessons from playing that game.

OmniFace War's Overall To Do List. Plenty more to do lists for individual levels.

I have actually been prototyping the story in the meantime using Twine. There's some improvements that need to be made once a bit more of the story is complete. Once I'm at a stage where I'm happy for people to take a look, I'll make it available for everyone to give feedback.

That about does it for this update. I do need to keep updating this blog and I'm aiming to do so at least once a week so people know what's going on.

Until next time,
Killerbyte
