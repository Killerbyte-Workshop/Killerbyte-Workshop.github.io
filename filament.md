## Every Filament

In this series, we'll be testing as many different filaments as I can get my hands on and we'll be testing for the following properties:
* Price
* Glass Transition Temperature
* Post Processing options
   This includes vapour smoothing, sanding, drilling, etc...
* Density
* Weight
* Layer Adhesion
* Cooling requirements
   How much cooling is necessary?
* Printing Requirements
   Do we need an enclosure? Do we need some form of adhesive for the bed?
* Temperature Resistance

We will eventually be testing for part strength and stiffness but I need to build machines first.

To start with we'll be testing
    eSUN PLA+
    Overture ASA
    Overture PETG 
    eSUN ePA-CF
    PC
    PA (Nylon)
    ABS
